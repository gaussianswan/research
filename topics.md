Reserch topics to tackle

* ARIMA+GARCH modeling for financial time series
    * Potentially building a trading strategy from this
* Conditional VAR estimation using different types of volatility models and conditional distributions
* Trying to predict fractionally differenced series rather than simple log returns
* Machine learning model for classification of buys and sells on SPY. Ensemble methods with it as well
* Deep Neural Network modeling for regression of financial time series
* Hierarchical clustering analysis on a set of stocks
* Setting up simple pairs trading strategy using cointegration tests and other things.
* How do you do simulations with the ARCH package? What simulations are available to us?
* Building an autoencoder for PCA-style analysis of a basket of stocks --> looking up the general autoencoding problem and seeing if we can train one
    * Interesting to create one for creating some sort of factors that are hidden in the data itself.

* Create an autoencoder which will serve as a step in the feature creation process and then feed those encoded features into some part of another model for predicting the stock price or some shit.
