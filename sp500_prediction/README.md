### S&P 500 Index Prediction

In this folder, we are going to attempt to do prediction on the S&P 500 index, one of the most watched indices in the world in regards to the United States Economy. 
We will use this to work out a lot of machine learning workflows such as: 
* Feature creation and analysis 
* Feature selection
* Training, Validation, and Testing as well as cross validation 

The objectives that we will try out are: 
* Predicting the next day's S&P 500 return 
* Predicting the direction of the next day's S&P 500 return (if it will go up or down)

There are a lot of other things that we can do here, but we will focus on just doing this problem to showcase all the things that we can do.
